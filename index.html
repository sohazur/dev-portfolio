        <h3>Artist and Entrepreneur</h3>
        <p>
          I believe myself as a creative and original artist. I love doing
          versatile makeup looks and designing dresses. I have doing this for
          more than 3 years. Besides, I have taken my artistic skills into
          cooking as well. I create creative design cakes and I try different
          types of cooking items with my unique recipe. I am the Founder of "SIS
          Cakes", an online bakery shop.
